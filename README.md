# Human-Computer-Interaction
In this project, pulse measurement and analysis of the measured pulses are performed.
Instant Bpm (Beat Per Minute) is calculated as the number of beats per minute.
Heartbeat is indicated by graphs.
From the moment you put your finger, it will give you a value close to your actual heart rate.


In the project, the leds on the breadboard were set to pulse and turn on and off once each time the heart beats.
The Pulse Sensor has 3 tips;
        -Gnd (earth), Vcc (5v), pulse pin
Pulse Pin is connected to pin analog0 (a0) since it receives values (variable) in variable pwm range.
Port Selection Front window is set.
The amplitude can be changed using the ScollBar.
Pressing the ‘s ken key while the program is running can save the window image to the project file.
